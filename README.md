# Linespeak
 I invented a language based on the Binary for ASCII, this makes it easier to use.

 Essentially, starting from directly upwards, a line is either drawn or not drawn at every 45-degree interval according to the binary code of a particular character. Because the upward direction will never be used, it connects words.
